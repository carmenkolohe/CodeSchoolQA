## Streaming the Process 
üé•

Please join us on Twitch Fridays @ noonish on https://www.twitch.tv/jendevelops. We can talk about it all... MVP, structuring, wireframes, tech stack, backend, frontend, etc.. together! üíû We also plan on documenting the whole journey, including how we review PRs during the live streams!

## Description 
üë∑

A webapp to organize questions and answers for the [Code School Q&A Stream](twitch.tv/thejonanshow) built using

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/documentation)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Google Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database)

## Goals
ü¶æ

Code School Q&A aims to help people enter the tech industry from any background! This project has 2 goals:

1. Streamline questions and answers for the [Code School Q&A Stream](twitch.tv/thejonanshow)
1. Create a welcoming environment for code newbies who want to have a safe space to contribute to an open source project for the first time

## Want to Contribute?

## Background
üßê

Hi Friends! Although your journey into tech may seem like a dumpster fire at times, this dumpster fire will give you light and keep you warm. Please join us in building the official Code School Q&A web app. Our goal is to have our friends, students, and folks that may not have a chance to ask a question during the stream be able to submit questions that we could try our best to answer during the stream. At the moment, there is a Firebase database set up to store questions submitted.

We are open to any ideas for this app! This is an open source project for anyone in their journey in coding. Please feel free to create an issue and let us know how we can improve the documentation.

So far, there is a main page that has a small explanation, a form to submit a question, a modal that pops up that a question was sent, and a list of questions displayed below the form. It is fully functioning! The question is sent to a firebase database and the questions are fetched from same database. Please feel free to get creative and submit a PR with your design!

If you are unfamiliar with either NextJS or Sass, there is fantastic documentation to help you get going. Youtube and Udemy have also been great resources for learning.

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/documentation)
  - Note: Feel free to write regular CSS in the Sass files, that is one of the great things about Sass!

Super open to suggestions and open to learn with you. If you find that there is a better library or technology that could help improve the project, feel free to create an issue and let's taco bout it üåÆ
